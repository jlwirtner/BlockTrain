# BlockTrain

## All Aboard!

The BlockTrain is leaving the station. Don't let your model get left behind!

## Goal

Oh boy, it's a big one.

Haven't you always dreamed of training your computationally expensive models on some other chump's computer?

Have you been dying for an opportunity to mine an exciting new cryptocurrency?

Sure Google Cloud and Bitcoin exist, but as two separate entities. What if I told you some idiot's trying to cram them together into some horrible Franken-tech-mess that no one asked for?

What if I stopped asking a bunch of stupid rhetorical questions?

Well you're in the right place. BlockTrain aims to be a decentralized blockchain technology that can be used to train neural networks. The proof of work for each block consists of not only computing hashes, but a paramter update for a deep learning model.

Users can request to have a model trained, which amounts to the creation of a new chain. Nodes work to update model parameters, moving the chain along and earn digital currency for their efforts.

Training requests will be paid for in said digital currency.

## Coal

Oh yeah, the currency is going to be called **coal** until I can think of something cooler.

...Get it? ...BlockTrain ...Trains run on coal ...I'll shut up now.
